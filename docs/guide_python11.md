gpt5:
I'll run a few PowerShell commands to detect installed Python versions and check if Poetry is available so I can give exact steps to make Poetry use Python 3.11 (expected outcome: list of interpreters, confirmation of Python 3.11 availability, location of the default python, and whether Poetry is installed). I'll run four short commands in the terminal and report the outputs. 

Ran terminal command: py -0p

Next I'll check python --version and where python points to. 

Ran terminal command: python --version; Get-Command python | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Source

Now I'll look for python3.11 or python3.11.exe and check common install locations for Python 3.11. I'll run where.exe for python3.11 and python311. 

Ran terminal command: where python3.11.exe, python311.exe, python3.11, python311 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; Get-ChildItem 'C:\Program Files\Python*','C:\Program Files (x86)\Python*','C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\*' -Directory -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName

I'll check the Python 3.11 executable version at the detected path and see if Poetry is installed (expected outcome: confirm Python 3.11 is available and whether poetry command exists). I'll run two terminal commands and report results. 

Ran terminal command: C:\Users\Dragos\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe --version

Ran terminal command: poetry --version

I'll summarize what I found, then give exact, copy-paste PowerShell steps to make Poetry use Python 3.11 for this project (including a failsafe manual venv option). Say if you want me to run these in your workspace.

What I ran and found
- The Windows Python launcher `py` isn't present on this system (so use explicit python.exe paths).
- `python --version` points to Python 3.13.2 at:
  python.exe
- You do have Python 3.11 installed at:
  python.exe (reports Python 3.11.0)
- Poetry is installed and callable: Poetry (version 1.8.3)

Goal / plan (short)
1. Ensure your pyproject.toml declares a compatible python constraint (so Poetry won't refuse the chosen interpreter).  
2. Tell Poetry to use your Python 3.11 interpreter for the project: `poetry env use <path-to-python.exe>`.  
3. (Optional but recommended) Configure Poetry to create the virtualenv inside the project (.venv).  
4. Install dependencies and verify the environment uses Python 3.11.

Step-by-step (PowerShell) — copy/paste these

1) Edit your pyproject.toml (recommended constraint)
- If you want to force Poetry to require only Python 3.11, set the project python constraint like this in `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`:
  - To pin to 3.11.x only:
    python = ">=3.11,<3.12"
  - If you'd rather allow any 3.x >= 3.11 use:
    python = ">=3.11"
  (Edit the file in your editor — don't run random sed commands unless you want me to do it.)

2) Make Poetry create the virtualenv inside the project (optional but convenient)
- This ensures the venv will live at `./.venv` and avoid global PATH confusion:
```powershell
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true --local
```

3) Tell Poetry to use the Python 3.11 interpreter you already have
- Replace the path if your 3.11 is elsewhere; using the path discovered earlier:
```powershell
poetry env use "C:\Users\Dragos\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe"
```
- If Poetry reports "The specified Python version is incompatible…" then adjust the `python` field in pyproject.toml to allow 3.11 (see step 1).

4) Create environment & install
```powershell
poetry install
```

5) Verify the environment uses Python 3.11
```powershell
poetry run python --version
poetry env info --path
poetry env list
```
- `poetry run python --version` should print a 3.11.x version.

Alternative: manually create an in-project venv and use it
- If you prefer to control venv creation yourself:
```powershell
# create .venv using Python 3.11
C:\Users\Dragos\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe -m venv .venv

# activate it in PowerShell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# inside the venv, python will be 3.11
python --version

# then install project deps via Poetry while inside the activated venv:
poetry install
```
Note: when inside an activated venv, `poetry` will use that interpreter for installs.

Common pitfalls & troubleshooting
- If Poetry refuses to use 3.11, check pyproject.toml's python constraint (it must allow 3.11). If it doesn't, change it and retry `poetry env use`.
- If `poetry` is not found after activating a venv, install it into that venv (`pip install poetry`) or just use the global Poetry with `poetry env use <path>`.
- If you want the `python` command globally to point to 3.11, modify PATH or use the Python installer options — I don't recommend changing global defaults unless necessary.

Would you like me to run the Poetry commands now (set in-project venv + `poetry env use` + `poetry install`) in your workspace? If so, I’ll execute them and report back the results and any errors.
